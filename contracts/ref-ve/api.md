# API for REF-VE

## Logic
### User Roles
There are three user roles:
* User
    * Can lock lptoken to got veToken and loveToken,
    * Ve holders can participate in the referendum,
    * Can claim voting reward to inner account,
    * Can withdraw assets from inner account to user wallet,
* Operator (also could be a user)
    * adjust locking policy,
    * adjust the minimum start voting offset time,
    * manage whitelisted accounts,
* Owner (mostly is a DAO)
    * set owner to another account,
    * manage operators,
    * refund from seed lostfound,
    * upgrade the contract,

### Locking Policy
Every User can lock their lptoken with a specific period to got veToken/loveToken.

$$
X = A + A \frac{D(M_{max} - M_{min})}{D_{max} M_{min}}
$$

Where,  
$X$ is vetoken/loveToken amount,  
$A$ is locking lptoken amount,  
$D$ is user requested locking period,  
$D_{max}$ is the maximum locking duration, such as 360 days,  
$M_{min}$ is base BP ratio litterally is 10000,  
$M_{max}$ is multiple BP ratio related to $D_{max}$, say 20000,  

**Example:**  
Alice locking 30 lptoken for 60 days,  
$$
X = 30 + 30* \frac{60*(2.0 - 1.0)}{360*1.0} = 35
$$


**Append to Current Locking**  
Require:
- The new unlock timestamp must be later than current one;

Algorithm:  
1. Using the new duration to re-lock current locking balance, if new $X$ is larger, then update it, $X = Max(X, X_{new})$
2. Lock the append amount, got the extra $X_{append}$
3. $X = X + X_{append}$

## Interface
### User Register
This contract obeys NEP-145 to manage storage, but choose a fixed storage fee policy in this contract. Each user only needs deposit to lock a fixed 0.00125 NEAR as storage cost.

Detailed interface description could be found at [NEP-145](https://nomicon.io/Standards/StorageManagement.html).

Here we only list some common-use interfaces:

* `storage_deposit`, to register a user,
* `storage_unregister`, to unregister caller self and get 0.00125 NEAR back,
* `storage_balance_of`, to get given user storage balance,
* `storage_balance_bounds`, to get storage policy.

Note: 
- To sucessfully unregister, user should withdraw all his lptoken and reward tokens before calling `storage_unregister`.
- Support having a sponsor to deposit storage for user, in that case, when `storage_unregister`, the fixed 0.00125 near would transfer back to that sponsor. Can use `get_account_info(account_id)` to check it.

### User Lock/Append/Withdraw
```rust
enum MFTokenReceiverMessage {
    Lock { duration_sec: u32 },
    Append { append_duration_sec: u32 }
}
```
**Lock**  
are executed by calling lptoken's `mft_transfer_call ` with the following msg:
Eg:
```bash
near call $MFT mft_transfer_call '{"receiver_id": "'$VE'", "token_id": ":0", "amount": "1'$ZERO24'", "msg": "{\"Lock\":{\"duration_sec\":5184000}}"}' --account_id=u1.testnet --depositYocto=1 --gas=150$TGAS
```
**Append** 
are executed by calling lptoken's `mft_transfer_call ` with the following msg:
Eg:
```bash
near call $MFT mft_transfer_call '{"receiver_id": "'$VE'", "token_id": ":0", "amount": "1'$ZERO24'", "msg": "{\"Append\":{\"append_duration_sec\":0}}"}' --account_id=u1.testnet --depositYocto=1 --gas=150$TGAS
```
**Withdraw**  
are unified into one interface `withdraw_lpt`:
```rust
pub fn withdraw_lpt(&mut self, amount: Option<U128>)  -> Promise 
```
Eg:
```bash
near call $VE withdraw_lpt --account_id=u1.testnet --depositYocto=1 --gas=150$TGAS
```
Note: 
1. If amount is not given, withdraw all balance.

### Deposit Reward to Proposal
are executed by calling reward token's `ft_transfer_call ` with the following msg:
```rust
enum FTokenReceiverMessage {
    Reward { proposal_id: u32, incentive_key: u32 }
}
```
Eg:
```bash
near call ref.$FT ft_transfer_call '{"receiver_id": "'$VE'", "amount": "36'$ZERO18'", "msg": "{\"Reward\":{\"proposal_id\":0, \"incentive_key\": 0}}"}' --account_id=u1.testnet --depositYocto=1 --gas=100$TGAS || true
```
### Proposal

**Create Proposal**  
```rust

    FarmingReward { 
        farm_list: Vec<String>,
        total_reward: u32
    },
    Poll {
        options: Vec<String>,
    },
    Common,
}

pub fn create_proposal(
        &mut self,

        description: String,
        start_at: u32,
        duration_sec: u32,
